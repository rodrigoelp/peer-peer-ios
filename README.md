# Building a simple peer to peer messaging app

This repo contains the code required to build a very simple peer to peer messaging app for iOS devices.

This application uses iOS multipeer connectivity framework. The first iteration of this app will be extremely simple, including all the code as part of its view controller. Later on, I will iterate on this design to pull it as part of a flow controller (and possibly include a collection view to display all messages over time).

Enjoy!

*Note:* this was built using swift 5 and xcode 10.2.1
